# Trace tool

The trace tool is available [here](http://www.openfisca.fr/tools/trace).

## Presentation

This tool helps understanding the results of a simulation.

The basic idea is to allow users to navigate between variables and their dependencies, and see their respective results.

The tool takes as input a [simulation JSON]() as accepted by the [web API](../openfisca-web-api/json-data-structures).
