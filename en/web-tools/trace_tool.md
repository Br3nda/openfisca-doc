# Trace tool

The trace tool is available [here](http://www.openfisca.fr/tools/trace).

## Presentation

This tool helps understanding the results of a simulation.

The basic idea is to allow users to navigate between variables and their dependencies, and see their respective results.

The tool takes as input a JSON description of a scenario as accepted by the [web API](../openfisca-web-api/json-data-structures.md).

## Using from the demonstrator

You can open the trace tool from the OpenFisca [demonstrator](http://ui.openfisca.fr/) by clicking on the menu "Action" then on the "trace" entry. The current scenario will be pre-filled.

## Using from Python
