# Web tools

The OpenFisca team has created several [web tools](http://www.openfisca.fr/tools) which help to understand the legislation or to write formulas.

- [The Legislation Explorer](legilsation_exlorer.md) is a wonderful tool to understand the french legislation and the dependencies between OpenFisca variables.
- [The Trace tool](trace_tool.md) is a good help to understand the computation OpenFisca has made.



#### The Legislation Explorer tool

You can have a look of all variables implemented in OpenFisca through the [Legislation Explorer](https://legislation.openfisca.fr/) tool.

To understand how to use it, please see the corresponding documentation Section [here](web-tools/legislation_explorer.md).
