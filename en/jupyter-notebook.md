# Work with Jupyter Notebook

[Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) is a useful way to use OpenFisca without using any source code editor.

A notebook is basically a web interface running in your browser, in which you write code and it displays results.

You can work with the public notebook server of OpenFisca or install Jupyter Notebook on your computer.

## Use OpenFisca Jupyter Notebook

As a requirement you must have a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.

- Go to https://jupyter.openfisca.fr/
- Login with your GitHub account
- You have now a personal space to store and run your notebooks

The performance of the server are quite low.

Warning! There is no guarantee with your data so please backup your notebooks.

## Install Jupyter Notebook

If you want more performance or don't want to risk to loose your data, you can [install Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html) on your computer.
