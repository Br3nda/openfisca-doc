## Project history

The development of OpenFisca began in May 2011 at the
[<abbr title="Centre d'analyse stratégique">CAS</abbr>](http://www.strategie.gouv.fr/)
(renamed France Stratégie / Commissariat général à la stratégie et à la prospective in April 2013)
with the support of the
[<abbr title="Institut d'économie publique">IDEP</abbr>](http://www.idep-fr.org/).

The source code has been released under a free software license in November 2011.

OpenFisca was originally developed as a desktop application
using the [Qt](http://www.qt.io/) library with a Python API.

In the early 2014, when <a href="https://www.etalab.gouv.fr/" rel="external" target="_blank">Etalab</a>
started being implicated in the development of OpenFisca, it was decided to:

- separate the computing engine from its desktop user interface
- offer a web API in addition to the Python API
- demonstrate the value of the web API by developing sample applications including a web interface
  to simulate personal cases
- propose a public access to this web API open to all: administrations, researchers, citizens, etc.

Since then, the software is being developed extensively by
[Etalab](https://www.etalab.gouv.fr/).
Meanwhile the economic model is being improved and the tax and benefit legislation updated by the
[<abbr title="Commissariat général à la stratégie et à la prospective">CGSP</abbr>](http://www.strategie.gouv.fr/)
with the help of the
the [<abbr title="Institut d'économie publique">IDEP</abbr>](http://www.idep-fr.org/)
and the [<abbr title="Institut des politiques publiques">IPP</abbr>](http://www.ipp.eu/).

As of now (March 2014), the Qt version is no longer maintained and only the Python and the web APIs are being developed.
