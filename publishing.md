# Publishing results based on OpenFisca

OpenFisca is free software made available under an [AGPL license](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/agpl-3.0/). This means that you are free to use, install and modify it, but that you have to contribute your changes back to the community. This is the only way a digital common can be sustainable, and we are very happy that you take part in this shared effort!

## Hosting an API instance

If you provide a service that uses OpenFisca, either bundled in a program or serving it over the network, be it directly or wrapped through another API layer, you have to credit OpenFisca, give a link to its source code and license.

The following HTML snippet can be used to credit OpenFisca, for example in your footer or “about” page.
Please make sure to update the destination of the source code link if you use a modified version!

## Changes

If you modify or extend OpenFisca, you are [legally required](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/agpl-3.0/) to make those changes available to the community. The easiest way to do it is to publish your fork, extension or reform on a source hosting platform such as GitHub, and to [notify](./community.md) the core team of this publication.

Please note that, under AGPL provisions, serving over the network is considered as publishing changes, which means you also have to make your changes available even if you don't keep the running instance on your servers.
