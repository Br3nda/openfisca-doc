## About this documentation

This documentation is built with the excellent [GitBook](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook) tool.

It is written in [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
and the source is hosted on this GitHub repository:
[openfisca/openfisca-gitbook](https://github.com/openfisca/openfisca-gitbook).

If you'd like to build it by yourself, here are the steps.

```
git clone
npm install
```

Then you can either build the documentation or launch a local HTTP server with watch mode:

```
npm run build
or
npm run watch
```

> With watch mode, open http://localhost:4000/ in your browser once the first build is done.
