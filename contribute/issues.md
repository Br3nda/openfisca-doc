# Issues

Each OpenFisca project has its own issues. See [OpenFisca repositories list](https://github.com/openfisca).

When an issue does not concern a repository in particular,
it must be stored in [OpenFisca-Core](https://github.com/openfisca/openfisca-core)
(ie https://github.com/openfisca/openfisca-core/issues/334).
