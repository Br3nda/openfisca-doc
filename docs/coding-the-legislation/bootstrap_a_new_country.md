Sorry, this section is not yet written :-(

OpenFisca is designed to work on any country.

Currently the maintained country is France via the [OpenFisca-France](https://github.com/openfisca/openfisca-france) GitHub repository.

A proof of concept of doing a new country has been made with [OpenFisca-Tunisia](https://github.com/openfisca/openfisca-tunisia) but it's not always in sync.
